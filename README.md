# CS-Final

2014 Timetable application.

## Proposal
Our project is a timetable creator for students. It will create courses using a student database, and will use a priority system. A student will be able to log into the program, and select courses **which are available based on grade level**. After they select and submit, the program will input the student’s data into their account, and generate classes based on their and other students’ requests. After it generates the **available** courses, the student will also select a time slot for each class, based on availability of rooms and teachers.

### Features:
- Course selection: Students can request which courses they would like to have.
- Generates classes: After it takes the students requests, and all of the students in the classes, it will generate classes and timeslots for each specific class.
- Time slot selection: Allows students to select when their classes will be held.
- Shows student timetable: Allows students to view their final timetable.
